# Phishing Email Analysis for Small Business

## Overview

This project documents my work with a small business to establish a structured approach for phishing email analysis. The goal was to improve email security practices, identify phishing threats, and raise employee awareness of phishing risks.

## Objectives

- Establish a basic process for reporting and analysing phishing emails.
- Examine email headers, attachments, and links for signs of phishing.
- Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and use threat intelligence to assess risks.
- Suggest improvements to email security and employee awareness.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Splunk** – Log analysis and identification of phishing trends.
- **Zeek** – Monitoring network traffic for phishing-related activity.
- **Suricata** – Detection of potential phishing threats.
- **VirusTotal** – Scanning suspicious URLs and attachments.
- **Email Header Analyzer** – Checking email authenticity.
- **Python** – Used to help extract and analyse email data.

## Process

### 1. Email Collection & Initial Review

- Employees forwarded suspicious emails to a dedicated security mailbox.
- I organised and securely stored the emails for analysis.

### 2. Email Header Analysis

- Checked SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for authentication failures.
- Reviewed sender details and email metadata for inconsistencies.
- Identified signs of spoofing and other suspicious behaviour.

### 3. URL and Attachment Analysis

- Extracted and scanned URLs using VirusTotal.
- Opened attachments in a safe environment to check for malicious content.
- Used basic Python scripts to help analyse email content.

### 4. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

- Gathered key IOCs, including sender addresses, domains, URLs, and file hashes.
- Cross-checked IOCs with open-source threat intelligence feeds.
- Logged findings in Splunk to improve future detection.

### 5. Reporting & Mitigation

- Documented phishing trends and common attack methods in a report.
- Provided recommendations such as:
  - Strengthening email security settings.
  - Enhancing spam filtering rules.
  - Conducting basic phishing awareness training for employees.
- Suggested steps for handling future phishing incidents.

## Results

- Identified multiple phishing attempts targeting employees.
- Improved employee awareness, leading to better reporting of suspicious emails.
- Provided recommendations that enhanced email filtering and detection.
- Created a simple process for employees to report phishing emails.

## Future Improvements

- Automate parts of the email analysis process using Python scripts.
- Explore SOAR tools to speed up phishing response.
- Conduct regular phishing simulations to test employee awareness.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in phishing email analysis, helping a small business improve its ability to detect and respond to phishing threats. Using tools like Splunk, Zeek, and Suricata, I developed a structured approach to identifying phishing attacks and enhancing email security practices.
