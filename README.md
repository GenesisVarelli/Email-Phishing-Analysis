# Case Study: Email Phishing Analysis

## Overview  
We worked with a financial services company (let’s call them *the Company*) to help their team better understand phishing emails — and how tricky these scams can be. The goal was simple: show how easy it is to make phishing emails look believable, and then teach employees how to spot and stop them.

## What We Did

### Task 1: Took a Really Obvious Fake Email and Made It Look Real  
We started with a phishing email that was obviously fake. Then, using some clever tweaks, we made it much more convincing. This included:  
- Making the sender’s address look authentic  
- Adding professional branding that matches what the Company usually sends  
- Crafting a message that feels relevant and urgent (because that’s what real scammers do!)  

This showed just how small changes can trick people into clicking on bad links.

### Task 2: Created a Short, Clear Presentation to Help Everyone Stay Safe  
Next, we put together a quick presentation to help employees learn the basics of spotting phishing emails. We covered things like:  
- What red flags to watch out for (like weird links or unexpected attachments)  
- Easy ways to double-check if an email is real  
- How to report anything suspicious quickly  

The goal was to give everyone the confidence to avoid falling for these scams.

## Why It Matters  
Phishing is one of the most common ways hackers try to break into companies. By showing how easy it is to create believable phishing emails — and teaching people what to look for — we helped the Company get ahead of the threat. Now their team is better equipped to protect themselves and the company’s data.

## What We Achieved  
- Highlighted how even obvious phishing emails can be improved to trick people  
- Delivered practical training that employees can actually use  
- Helped the Company build stronger security habits  
- Made employees more confident in spotting and reporting phishing attempts  

All in all, it was a great step toward keeping everyone safer online.
