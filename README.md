# Case Study: Email Phishing Analysis

## Overview  
We worked with a financial services company to help their team better understand phishing emails and how tricky these scams can be. The goal was simple: show how easy it is to make phishing emails look believable, and then teach employees how to spot and stop them.

## What We Did

### Task 1: Took a Really Obvious Fake Email and Made It Look Real  
We started with a phishing email that was obviously fake. Then, using some clever tweaks, we made it much more convincing. This included:  
- Making the sender’s address look authentic  
- Adding professional branding that matches what the Company usually sends  
- Crafting a message that feels relevant and urgent (because that’s what real scammers do!)  

This showed just how small changes can trick people into clicking on bad links.

### Task 2: Created a Short, Clear Presentation to Help Everyone Stay Safe  
Next, we put together a quick presentation to help employees learn the basics of spotting phishing emails. We covered things like:  
- What red flags to watch out for (like weird links or unexpected attachments)  
- Easy ways to double-check if an email is real  
- How to report anything suspicious quickly  

The goal was to give everyone the confidence to avoid falling for these scams.

## Why It Matters  
Phishing is one of the most common ways hackers try to break into companies. By showing how easy it is to create believable phishing emails and teaching people what to look for we helped the Company get ahead of the threat. Now their team is better equipped to protect themselves and the company’s data.

## What We Achieved  
- Highlighted how even obvious phishing emails can be improved to trick people  
- Delivered practical training that employees can actually use  
- Helped the Company build stronger security habits  
- Made employees more confident in spotting and reporting phishing attempts  

All in all, it was a great step toward keeping everyone safer online.
