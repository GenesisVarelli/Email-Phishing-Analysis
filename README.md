# Mastercard Email Phishing Project

This project is designed to enhance security awareness and demonstrate how easily phishing attacks can be made believable. It includes two main tasks to help improve email security and provide a practical solution for teams to recognise and defend against phishing attempts.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Examine an Obvious Fake Email and Make It More Believable
- In this task, a clearly fake phishing email will be reviewed and improved to make it more convincing.
- Techniques such as improved email design, social engineering tactics, and realistic content will be used to enhance the believability of the email.

### Task 2: Create a Short Presentation to Help Teams Improve Security Awareness
- A concise presentation aimed at educating teams about phishing risks and how to spot suspicious emails.
- The presentation will cover key security tips, red flags to look for, and best practices to follow to reduce the likelihood of falling for phishing attacks.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to provide practical insights into how phishing attacks operate and equip teams with the knowledge to identify and respond to these threats effectively.
